*   **Performance:** The application must be responsive and fast, with minimal loading times for all features.
*   **Scalability:** While initially for two users, the architecture should allow for potential future expansion of features or user base without significant re-architecture.
*   **Usability (UI/UX):** The interface must be intuitive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing. Navigation should be straightforward, and key information easily accessible. Responsive design for various devices (web, mobile).
*   **Reliability:** The application should be stable and available with minimal downtime. Data integrity must be maintained.
*   **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain and update.
*   **Integration:** Ability to integrate with third-party financial APIs (e.g., Plaid, Yodlee) for bank account aggregation, if feasible and secure. (This will be a significant technical challenge and may be considered for a later phase).

*   **Backend:** Robust and scalable backend (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails) to handle data processing, API integrations, and user authentication.
*   **Database:** A reliable database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing user data, financial records, and relationship content.
*   **Cloud Platform:** Deployment on a secure and scalable cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
*   **Security Protocols:** Implementation of OAuth2 for authentication, end-to-end encryption for sensitive data.

## 8. Open Questions / Dependencies

*   Specific lovable.dev capabilities and limitations for backend and database hosting.
*   Feasibility and security implications of direct bank account integration via third-party APIs.
*   User preferences for specific UI/UX styles or existing applications they admire.

This PRD serves as a foundational document for the development of the couple's collaboration web application. It will be a living document, subject to refinement and updates as the project progresses.
