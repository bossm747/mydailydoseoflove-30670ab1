# Implementation Guides and Rules

## 1. Introduction

This document provides comprehensive implementation guides and rules for developing the couple's collaboration web application on lovable.dev. These guidelines ensure consistent development practices, maintain code quality, and provide clear direction for implementing each feature according to the established requirements and design specifications. The guides are structured to support both the initial development phase and ongoing maintenance of the application.

## 2. Development Environment Setup

### 2.1. Prerequisites and Tools

Before beginning development on lovable.dev, ensure that the development environment meets all necessary requirements and follows established best practices for modern web application development.

The development environment should be configured with Node.js version 18 or higher to ensure compatibility with the latest JavaScript features and security updates. The package manager should be npm or yarn, with preference given to npm for consistency with most lovable.dev projects. Git should be configured for version control with proper commit message conventions and branching strategies.

For the frontend development, the environment should include React 18 with TypeScript support, ensuring type safety throughout the application. The development server should support hot module replacement for efficient development workflows. ESLint and Prettier should be configured for consistent code formatting and quality enforcement.

The backend development environment requires Express.js with TypeScript configuration, PostgreSQL for database management, and proper environment variable management for different deployment stages. Development tools should include database migration utilities, API testing tools like Postman or Insomnia, and debugging capabilities for both frontend and backend components.

### 2.2. Project Structure and Organization

The project structure should follow modern best practices for full-stack web applications, with clear separation between frontend and backend components while maintaining logical organization that supports the application's dual nature as both a business tool and relationship platform.

The root directory should contain separate folders for the client-side React application and the server-side Express API. Configuration files, documentation, and deployment scripts should be organized at the root level for easy access and maintenance. The database schema files, migration scripts, and seed data should be properly organized within the backend structure.

Within the frontend directory, components should be organized by feature domains rather than technical layers. This means having separate folders for authentication, dashboard, finance, business, relationship, and settings features. Each feature folder should contain its own components, hooks, services, and types, promoting modularity and maintainability.

The backend should follow a similar domain-driven organization with separate modules for authentication, financial management, business collaboration, and relationship features. Each module should contain its own routes, controllers, services, and data access layers. Shared utilities, middleware, and configuration should be organized in common directories accessible to all modules.

### 2.3. Coding Standards and Conventions

Consistent coding standards are essential for maintaining code quality and enabling effective collaboration. The application should follow established TypeScript and React best practices while incorporating specific conventions that support the unique requirements of a couple's collaboration platform.

TypeScript should be used throughout the application with strict type checking enabled. All components, functions, and data structures should have proper type definitions. Interface definitions should be comprehensive and descriptive, particularly for data models that represent financial transactions, business tasks, and relationship content.

React components should follow functional component patterns with hooks for state management. Component names should be descriptive and follow PascalCase convention. Props should be properly typed with interfaces, and default props should be used where appropriate. Components should be designed for reusability while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

CSS styling should follow a consistent methodology, preferably using CSS modules or styled-components to avoid global namespace pollution. The design system color palette and typography should be implemented as CSS custom properties or theme variables for consistent application throughout the interface.

Database naming conventions should use snake_case for table and column names, with descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose and relationships of each entity. Foreign key relationships should follow consistent naming patterns, and all tables should include created_at and updated_at timestamps for audit purposes.
